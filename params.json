{"name":"Sepr-eep.GitHub.io","tagline":"","body":"# TAxE Game\r\n\r\n**This is the website for the TAxE Game developed by the EEP team for the Software Engineering Project module at the Department of Computer Science, University of York.**\r\n\r\nIt is a train simulator game that can be played by two players over the Internet.\r\n\r\n## Run the game\r\n\r\nYou can run the Game on virtually any PC with the Java Runtime Environment version 8 or higher. You can download the JRE for free at [java.com](http://java.com). The game has been tested to work on the Windows and Linux PCs at the Department of Computer Science, University of York.\r\n\r\n1. Download [taxe-game.jar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SEPR-EEP/taxe-game/master/taxe-game.jar) and open it;\r\n2. If a security prompt is shown, click \"Allow\" - we're trustworthy;\r\n3. Click OK to choose default game server and run the game;\r\n4. Play!\r\n\r\n**Important**. If you are running the game on Linux, make sure you use Oracle's JRE and not the OpenJDK Runtime Environment, that sometimes comes with your distribution.\r\n\r\n### Host your own server\r\n\r\nBy default, the Game tries to connect to an instance of the Game server that can be used for testing.\r\n\r\nTo host your own server, you'll need a PC running either Linux or Mac OS with NodeJS installed. [You can download NodeJS from here](http://nodejs.org/).\r\n\r\nTo run the server, type in a terminal:\r\n```bash\r\ngit clone https://github.com/SEPR-EEP/taxe-server\r\ncd taxe-server\r\nnode server.js\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will start a game server listening on port `8042`. Make sure this port is reachable from the Internet. You can then type `http://<your-ip>:8042` to connect to your server when starting the Game.\r\n\r\n**Note**: In some Linux distributions such as Ubuntu and its derivatives, you may need to type `nodejs` instead of `node`.\r\n\r\n## Authors\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
